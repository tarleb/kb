Markdown usually treats line breaks within paragraphs like spaces, but this can create problems when writing in an East Asian language. 

When you want pandoc to ignore line breaks between wide characters, use [this extension](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-east_asian_line_breaks):

```pandoc -f markdown+east_asian_line_breaks
```
