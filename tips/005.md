# Line breaks and abbreviations

Markdown tip: pandoc prevents line breaks after certain abbreviations.
For example, "Oct.Â 31" is treated as a single word: pandoc replaces the
normal space character with a no-break space. To view the default list of abbreviations, use
`pandoc --print-default-data-file=abbreviations`. Use (a) custom abbrevs (abbreviations?) file
with `pandoc --abbreviations=...`
