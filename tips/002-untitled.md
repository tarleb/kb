## Code modes

Whether you prefer dark mode or light mode for your code, pandoc
has you covered: use `--highlight-style` to choose a consistent
setting which will apply to all code blocks. To view all options,
you can call a list of built-in style choices with
`--list-highlight-styles`. These styling settings work with docx,
pptx, LaTeX, groff, HTML, and EPUB.
