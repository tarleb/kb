# Download a nightly

If you're a pandoc user in need of a version that includes a recent bug fix, or
wants to test a feature recently added to the development version, download a
nightly. 

Using a nightly will ensure you're up to date with pandoc without having to keep
track of new releases. Binaries of the current pandoc development version are
created every 24 hours-- to access them,

1. go to GitHub actions at
   https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/actions?query=workflow%3ANightly
2. click on the latest result
3. download an artifact for Linux, macOS, or Windows.
