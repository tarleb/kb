Markdown has two kinds of links:

	[inline links](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL#inline-links)

and

	[reference links][1]

	[1]: https://pandoc.org/MANUAL#reference-links

The former is the default when producing Markdown, but the latter can be
generated by calling pandoc with the `--reference-links` option. Control the
placement of reference lists with `--reference-location`: either after each
block, each section, or at the end of the document.
