# Banish the braces

If you're tired of Markdown code blocks written with braces and
dots for the language, we have a solution for you: use `--to
markdown-fenced_code_attributes` to show the language without a
dot or braces.

This turns

`{.python} print("hello")`

into

`python print("hello")`,

which is both easier on the eyes and 
<!-- are there technical/practical reasons to use this, beyond it looking better?-->
